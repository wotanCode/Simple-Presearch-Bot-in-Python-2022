# Presearch-Bot by wotanCode

I managed to get this to work using:
- Windows 11 x64
- Chrome version 103.0.5060.53
- Python 3.10.5
- pip 22.1.2

This is not necessarily a requirement but I haven't tested it in other instances

### Do this commands:
- `pip install selenium`
- `pip3 install webdriver-manager`

### How work
- You need to log previously in presearch
- Do in the console: `py presearch_ch.py`

### TODO:
- Finish the firefox bot.
